## Requirements

This SDK has been compiled using Apple Swift version 5.10 (swiftlang-5.10.0.13 clang-1500.3.9.4). This compiler ensures optimal support for applications targeting iOS 13.0 and later, and provides full compatibility for code written in Swift 5.x.

If the following errors occur when using the SDK:

Incompatibility with other Swift versions (e.g., Swift 6.x)

Issues with binary files when using Xcode versions higher than those supported by Swift 5.10

we recommend switching to CocoaPods for proper SDK integration, where a stable version compatible with newer Swift versions or Xcode will be used.
